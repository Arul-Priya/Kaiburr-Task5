Consumer Complaint Text Classification

Overview

This project performs multi-class classification on consumer complaint texts.
The complaints are mapped into four categories:

0 â†’ Credit Reporting

1 â†’ Debt Collection

2 â†’ Consumer Loan

3 â†’ Mortgage


The workflow includes text cleaning, vectorization, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
